#### ---- SETUP ---- ####

# Ask user to input how many people will play,
# typecasted to an integer, and assign to num_players


# Create an empty LIST and assign to variable words



#### ---- input LOOP ---- ####

# Assign an empty string to variable current_word


# While current_word is not equal to "The end."


    # FOR i in RANGE num_players


        # Print blank line



        # --- Get next word --- #

        # Print "Player " + (i + 1) typecasted to a
        # string + ", it is your turn."


        # Ask the user to input a new word or 'The end.'
        # and assign it to current_word
        # ---> TEST AFTER THIS LINE <--- #


        # APPEND current_word to the list words



        # --- Stop when player enters "The end." --- #

        # If current_word is equal to "The end."
        # ---> TEST AFTER THESE LINES <--- #


            # break



#### ---- DISPLAY STORY ---- ####

# --- Assemble story from list --- #

# Assign empty string to variable story


# FOR EACH word in the list words


    # Increment story by word + " "
    # ---> TEST AFTER THIS LINE <--- #
